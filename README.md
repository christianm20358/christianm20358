- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Christian Miller

- Iâ€™m interested in software development, in particular in InfoSec, Distributed Systems, and Network programming. I've worked primarily with Go, C, Vue, Python and Powershell.
  
- You can find some additional projects of mine under the [Ganymede-Security](https://github.com/ganymede-security) Organization   
  
- Lately I've been interested in eBPF and am following its development and potential use cases quite closely, I think it could be a game changer for a lot of fields.  
  
- Side projects include developing projects dedicated to automation and security as well as more generalized tools that
  could be used in many projects. 
  
- How to reach me:
