- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Christian Miller

- Iâ€™m interested in software development, in particular in InfoSec, Distributed Systems, and Network programming. I've worked primarily with Go, Vue, Python and Powershell.
  
- You can find some additional projects of mine under the [Ganymede-Security](https://github.com/ganymede-security) Organization   
  
- I think security can be taken for granted partially because it rarely can be implemented without some impact to end users,
  and partially because security practices are often set aside in the interest of getting things done quickly.
  Therefore, my goal is to make security tools that make implementing security best practices seamless and easy to manage.

- Side projects include developing projects dedicated to automation and security as well as more generalized tools that
  could be used in many projects.
