- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Christian Miller
- Iâ€™m interested in Information Security and developing security related tools. I've worked primarily with Powershell,
  Go, Python, and Vue.
  
- I believe security is taken for granted, partially because it rarely can be implemented without some impact to end users,
  and partially because security practices are often left behind in the interest of getting things done quickly.
  Therefore, my goal is to make it easier for companies and security teams to manage
  security while keeping impacts to production to a minimum. 
  
- Currently my main project is developing an ecosystem of Security tools with an end goal
  of having a tool dedicated to each of the CIS18 Critical Security Controls.

- Side projects include developing Powershell modules dedicated to automation and security and a Go package of general tools that
  could be used in many projects.
